## Description

This application is for children (or adults who are kids at heart) to create their own version of the classic children's storybook.  Each chapter allows users to submit custom information (e.g. the name of the little girl in the story) which is dynamically rendered using React components, state changes, and ajax.  Upon saving, this information is saved to the database and persisted throughout the remaining chapters.  Also included are images corresponding to user input to create the true, magical, storybook effect.  

This application was inspired by my desire to blend the technology dependent society we live in today with the enchanting, classic picture books with which so many of us grew up (and loved)!

Users can:
- Navigate through the story
- Submit custom data that is saved to the database and persisted throughout the story
- Enjoy the images that are dynamically rendered based on user input

Challenges:
- First time using React
- Learn both the basics of React and figure out how to integrate React into a Rails application at the same time

Learnings:
- The importance of creating small, compact React components and the beauty of creating reusable components
- How powerful updating a component's state can be
- The lifecycle of React components and when certain functioned are executed (e.g. componentDidMount(), etc.)
- Ease and challenges of having JS, HTML, and styling in the same file
